**A sponsored shelf is a thoughtful and unusual gift for the Morpethian who cares about our heritage!**

**Help us raise funds for our museum collections rent for next year by donating an amount in your own name or as a gift for friends and family.**

Looking after our collections isn’t cheap. Our museum store costs around £5000 per year in rent alone to house 1300 artefacts, 2000 books and over 2000 photos/slides.

By sponsoring a shelf, unit, storage box or even single object you’ll be helping ensure we keep our collections safe and can continue researching the wealth of colourful stories of bygone Morpeth and its community. Meanwhile you’ll be safeguarding our heritage collections for the future as we work towards re-establishing our museum for tourists and residents back in Morpeth.

## Join the Morpeth Antiquarian Society

Morpeth Antiquarian Society is looking for a place to use its heritage collection of artefacts, pictures and documents to tell the stories of the town’s history.

After 32 years in the Chantry building the Society's local history museum was obliged by the borough council to go into store in the Town Hall in 1997.

In 2010 management changes at the building forced another move and now the museum collection is in temporary store outside the town at a costly rent.

Meanwhile, cataloguing, research work and fund-raising have continued, with an annual exhibition staged each summer, shop window displays provided for Heritage Open Days and artefacts brought to community groups.  It is the Society's intention to raise awareness and develop a vision for the future use of the collection.  Anyone wishing to help at our regular volunteer "hands-on" sessions or who has ideas for future premises, strategy and funding, please contact the secretary.
