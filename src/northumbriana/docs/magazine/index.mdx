Much of the magazine's contents are drawn from writing and composing entries submitted each year to the Morpeth Northumbrian Gathering competitions. These can be poems, prose, essays or plays, written in standard English or Northumbrian dialect. Musical compositions, tunes or songs, find room here.

Pleasingly, children have submitted entries of very high standard. Other articles covering a wide variety of subjects including architecture, traditional tales. folklore, music, archaeology humour, and reminiscences of the former way of life of Northumbnan farmers and fisherfolk. Last, but by no means least, the results of the Dialect Survey to date also appear.

Most back numbers are still available for purchase from Kim Bibby-Wilson at enquiries@northumbriana.org.uk or by ringing 01670 513308. It’s hoped to issue reprints of the remaining issues in due course.
