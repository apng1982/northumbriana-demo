We face growing challenges this year in planning and delivering our well-regarded regional festival of
traditional music and culture.  

Costs continue to rise, and we’ve had new problems over our venues, not least the
loss of the Town Hall for our events and admin hub on the Sunday (we are still seeking to have this reversed for
the future, but have had to alter much of the usual pattern across the three days in order not to disappoint our
audiences).  

To save some expenditure we are adapting the style of winners’ plaques, but in other cases we
cannot make savings – for instance, to ensure crowd safety we cannot shrink our Saturday showcase procession
by avoiding the now hugely-expensive road closure or relocating its route.  

Yet again we are hoping that the generosity of the public will help us to stage the type of events that people have come to expect at the Morpeth Gathering.

**This year includes some amazing events with special Vanbrugh Revisited activities for the 300th anniversary of the death of Town Hall architect Sir John Vanbrugh (nationally known for Castle Howard, Delaval Hall and Blenheim Palace).**

**This year we are delighted to announce the launch of the Alex Swailes Memorial Award for the best performance in speaking/reciting; and our clog dance competitions return after a gap after Covid.**

### Events Patron

For a minimum advance donation of £70 (or £110 per couple) you can receive a free pass to all
the weekend’s events (though seats are not guaranteed at the Chantry after an event starts thanks to size limits).

### Plaque Patron

For a minimum donation of £20 you can support the Northumbrian competitions by paying towards the cost of one of the many winners’ shields and certificates that we provide each year.
