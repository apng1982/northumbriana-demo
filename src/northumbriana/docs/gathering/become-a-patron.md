We face growing challenges this year in planning and delivering our well-regarded regional festival of
traditional music and culture.  

Costs continue to rise, and we’ve had new problems over our venues, not least the
loss of the Town Hall for our events and admin hub on the Sunday (we are still seeking to have this reversed for
the future, but have had to alter much of the usual pattern across the three days in order not to disappoint our
audiences).  

To save some expenditure we are adapting the style of winners’ plaques, but in other cases we
cannot make savings – for instance, to ensure crowd safety we cannot shrink our Saturday showcase procession
by avoiding the now hugely-expensive road closure or relocating its route.  

Yet again we are hoping that the
generosity of the public will help us to stage the type of events that people have come to expect at the Morpeth
Gathering. 

This year includes some amazing events - we have secured the coup of a special reunion concert by
NE folk legends Bob Fox and Stu Luckley, and are marking the 25th anniversaries of those Morpeth institutions,
the Old Bakehouse Yard Millennium Green, Voice Male choir, and the revamp of Carlisle Park with the return of
the park’s storyteller in residence, Shonaleigh.  

**We dedicate this 57th Gathering to Alex Swailes MBE, long-serving Morpeth Gadgy and face of the
Gathering. Alex handed over the Gadgy Staff to Ron Forster only last year, but sadly died very recently.**
By becoming our Patron you’ll enable us to continue our celebration of the Northumbrian culture that Alex so ably
personified. Ticket prices have forced up Event Patron costs, but we’ve lowered the Plaque Patron fee.

### Events Patron

For a minimum advance donation of £70 (or £100 per couple) you can receive a free pass to all
the weekend’s events (though seats are not guaranteed at the Chantry after an event starts thanks to size limits).

### Plaque Patron

For a minimum donation of £20 you can support the Northumbrian competitions by paying
towards the cost of one of the many winners’ shields and certificates that we provide each year.
