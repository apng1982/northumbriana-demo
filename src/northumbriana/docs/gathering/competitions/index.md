# 2026 Competitions

Our competitions are at the heart of the Gathering, continuing in the tradition of such cornerstone events at music festivals, village shows and literary awards. 

Through friendly encouragement and presenting opportunities for entertaining examples of the best in music, song, writing, composing, dialect, craft and dance, we hope to inspire people at all ages and levels to fancy having a go - and taking forward into the future - a range of creative activities rooted in our Northumbrian culture.
